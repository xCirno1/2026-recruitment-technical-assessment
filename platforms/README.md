# Technical Assessments

We offer two distinct assessment tracks and you're welcome to pick the one that interests you most.

This is designed to be accessible; even if these tools are new to you, this is an excellent opportunity to demonstrate your problem-solving logic and ability to learn on the fly—skills we use daily.
We'll be using these tools all throughout the year, so this is a great way to get familiar with them!
We value your process and effort far more than prior technical expertise.

- <img src="https://matrix.org/images/matrix-favicon.svg" height="20" alt="Matrix Logo"/> [Matrix](./matrix/README.md):
If you’re looking for something a bit more intense, you might prefer this.
It is definitely harder and will likely require some deep-dive research, but we think it's a much more rewarding and interesting project.

  If you decide to tackle the Matrix and realise halfway through that it's not the right fit, please don't worry about "giving up."
  You are more than welcome to switch over to Docker & Kubernetes and we will still take the progress you made on the harder task into account!

Whilst the assessment specs are detailed, they’re designed to be a helpful roadmap rather than a hurdle.
If any part feels unclear, please reach out in the [#platform-technical-assessment](https://discord.gg/UZzqSVdSKp) channel in the [DevSoc Discord](https://discord.gg/6fnHcuFFtz), we're here to help!

Good luck and have fun!
